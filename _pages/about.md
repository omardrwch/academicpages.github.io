I am a PhD student in [SequeL](https://team.inria.fr/sequel/) team at [Inria Lille - Nord Europe](https://www.inria.fr/), France, under the supervision of [Michal Valko](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/~valko/hp/) and [Emilie Kaufmann](http://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/ekaufman/). My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning in non-stationary environments.  

Before starting my PhD, I obtained a MSc in Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision at ENS Paris-Saclay, France, a Master's degree in engineering from École Centrale Paris/CentraleSupélec, France, and an electrical engineering degree from the University of Campinas, Brazil.
